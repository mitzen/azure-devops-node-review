# Welcome to the Parallo DevOps interview exercise!

This is a short exercise for you to show us your DevOps skillset. You are free to use this repository as you wish, alternatively you may clone this repo to another source code repository if you prefer. 

This project is made using Next.js running on Node.js, so you'll need Node.js and Next.js installed. You can get those here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### For this exercise, things you may need are:
- Docker
- Account with a cloud provider
- Git and/or a Git client of your choice
- Nodejs and npm, which can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### When you finish, you will have:
- A containerised app
- A deployment pipeline
- A container deployed to resources in a public cloud
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- A secure way to store private credentials

## To run this project
1. Run `npm install` 
1. Navigate to inside this directory and run `npm run dev`. It should then run the server on `localhost:3000`.
1. If it doesn't install properly, the manual installation instructions are here: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#manual-setup

## Good luck!
If you run out of time, sketch out your proposed solution so we can discuss your approach. We'd rather explore that than get too caught up in the specific implementation details.
